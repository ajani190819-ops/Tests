#requires -Version 5.1
<#
  AURA-BACKGROUND  v3
  Smooth animated keyboard lighting, direct HID LampArray control.

  WHAT CHANGED IN v3
    * The animation loop now runs in COMPILED C# on its own high-priority
      thread. PowerShell only sets things up. This is the real fix for the
      stutter: an interpreted loop cannot hold a 16 ms frame budget.
    * Frame pacing is sleep-then-spin, so frames land on time instead of
      drifting by whatever Start-Sleep felt like.
    * The gradient is now CYCLIC. The last colour blends back into the
      first, so a colour leaving the right edge returns on the left with
      no seam.

  QUICK USE
    .\Aura-Background.ps1 -Effect gradient -Colors "#FF0000,#FF7F00,#FFFF00,#00FF00,#0000FF,#8B00FF"
    .\Aura-Background.ps1 -Effect rainbow -Fps 60
    .\Aura-Background.ps1 -Effect off
    .\Aura-Background.ps1 -Restore

    // The ask is for the palette colours themselves to dominate and the

    // even sweep where every in-between shade gets equal time. So the
    // first and last 30% of each step are flat - exactly the palette
    // colour - and the middle 40% does the whole transition, eased at both
    // ends so it does not start or stop abruptly.
    //
    // How wide that middle window is depends on how many lamps the zone
    // has, and it has to.
    //
    // On the twelve light-bar lamps a narrow window is exactly right: at
    // any moment different lamps sit at different points, so the strip
    // shows solid blocks of colour with a short blend between them, which
    // is the look that was asked for.
    //
    // The keyboard has four lamps. With a narrow window all four sit
    // inside the flat holds nearly all the time, so instead of a gradient
    // travelling across the keys they sit on one colour, all flip
    // together, and sit on the next - blocks snapping rather than motion.
    // Widening the span does not help; it just lands more lamps in the
    // holds. The only fix is to give a sparse zone more of its cycle to
    // move in.
    //
    // So: twelve or more lamps keep a 35% window, four or fewer get 50%,
    // and anything between is interpolated. Both zones keep the same
    // palette and the same blend, so the colours are unchanged.
    //
    // The sparse zone used to get 75%. That was set when the blend still
    // went round the HSV hue circle and spent most of its length in a
    // washed-out smear, so a wide window was needed to keep the four
    // keyboard lamps from all sitting on an endpoint and flipping in
    // unison. Blending in OKLab removed the smear, which means the window
    // can come back in and give the palette colours themselves more of the
    // strip - measured on purple/orange, the second colour goes from 27.9%
    // of the cycle to 35.3% and the muddy middle drops from 31.8% to 21.2%.
    //
    // 0.50 is the floor, not a preference. At 0.40 the four keyboard lamps
    // are pinned on an endpoint 60% of the time and start snapping between
    // colours together, which was rejected before; 0.50 holds that at 50.8%
